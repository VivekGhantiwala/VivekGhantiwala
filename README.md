### The Journey

I'm an M.Sc student in Data Science & AI. Instead of paying ₹10+ lakhs for bootcamps, I'm teaching myself using curriculum from IIIT-Hyderabad, MIT, Stanford, and DeepLearning.AI.

No shortcuts. No excuses. Just consistent work.

**Currently:** Building my Data Science & AI skill set
**Goal:** Become someone FAANG companies want to hire
**Method:** One commit at a time
